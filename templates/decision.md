## Governance

This decision follows the
[Omnifi Foundation governance model](https://handbook.omnifi.foundation/engineering/architecture/governance/).
Technical leads carry responsibility for shepherding proposals through the
process. Decisions use lazy consensus — see the
[handbook](https://handbook.omnifi.foundation/engineering/architecture/governance/) for
details.
