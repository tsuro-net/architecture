# Request for comments

<!--
This template helps create proposals for community-facing changes and features.
Requests for comments are for interfaces, behaviours, and capabilities that
directly affect how people interact with or use Tsūro. For underlying
technical architecture and tooling decisions, use the architecture decision
record template instead.
